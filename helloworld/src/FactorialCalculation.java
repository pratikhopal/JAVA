//Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for-loop.
//Hint: The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product
// of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
// For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
//Think it through and give it a shot! If you need any hints or help, Iâ€™m right here.
